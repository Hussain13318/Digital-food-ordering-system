# **Digital-food-ordering-system**

This C++ project simulates a digital food ordering system. Users can log in with Gmail, password, and OTP, browse food categories, select items, specify quantities, and view an itemized bill with the total amount.

The system uses functions like menu, qty, and displayBill to handle orders, arrays to store item details, and switch cases and loops for menu navigation. It demonstrates basic programming concepts including authentication, arrays, strings, conditional statements, and user-defined functions.
